The Business Requirements Document was instrumental in defining the system’s core features: secure student registration, lesson scheduling, instructor feedback, and progress tracking. My priority was to create an intuitive experience for non-technical users particularly students and parents—while upholding strong performance and security measures such as multi-factor authentication and encrypted communication.

In the System Design Document, I leveraged UML diagrams to map out user interactions. Use case and activity diagrams clarified workflows like booking lessons and completing practice exams, while class and sequence diagrams helped establish object relationships and system behavior. These diagrams weren’t just theoretical they played a key role in communicating and refining the system’s architecture.

For future maintenance, I’d suggest integrating an issue reporting feature that connects directly to a ticketing system. This would streamline how admins track bugs and feature requests, eliminating the need for email threads or manual logs. I also prioritized flexibility in the design, enabling admins to update training packages without modifying the codebase.

To me, being an effective team member in system development means writing clear documentation, communicating proactively, and designing with scalability in mind. I aimed to embody those principles throughout the project. This course didn’t just teach me how to build a system—it taught me how to think like a systems analyst
